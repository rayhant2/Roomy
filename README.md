# Roomy

Roomy.co
Roomy.co is a mobile app designed to help university students find their perfect roommate. By combining the swiping mechanics of Tinder with an algorithm that matches users based on their preferences, Roomy.co makes the roommate search process fun, engaging, and efficient.

Inspiration
The idea for Roomy.co originated with three of our founders, all incoming university students who struggled to find suitable roommates. The challenge inspired us to develop an app that could streamline the process. One of our team members suggested adding a Tinder-style swiping feature to make the process of finding a roommate more interactive and enjoyable.

What It Does
Roomy.co allows users to find their ideal roommate by swiping on profiles:

Swipe left to decline.
Swipe right to accept.
Swipe up to chat.
Each profile card displays key information such as name, age, pronouns, university, room type, faith, etc. The app’s algorithm prioritizes profiles that closely match the user's preferences, ensuring the best possible roommate matches.

How We Built It
Roomy.co is built with the MERN stack:

MongoDB
ExpressJS
React Native
NodeJS
We also utilized TypeScript, Expo, and Android Studio for development. Our design process began in Figma, where we created the initial UI/UX layouts before moving into development.

Challenges We Ran Into
Our team encountered several challenges during development, particularly a lack of knowledge in React Native and Git. A notable challenge occurred when buggy code was merged into the main branch, causing significant delays as we worked to revert the commit. We overcame this challenge by seeking help from a mentor, who guided us through resolving the issue.

Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Despite the challenges, our team made significant strides in learning React Native and TypeScript. Starting from basic tutorials, we progressed to building components, screens, and solving complex problems related to the app. Additionally, two team members gained a foundational understanding of UI/UX design using Figma.

What We Learned
This project was a learning experience for all of us. We deepened our programming skills, improved our teamwork, and became more proficient with Git and React Native. We also learned the importance of resilience and collaboration, turning mistakes into opportunities for growth.

What's Next for Roomy.co
Our journey doesn't end with Ignition Hacks. We're committed to continuously improving Roomy.co, with the following plans:

Improving UI: Enhance the user interface for better navigation and accessibility.
AI Model Development: Implement and fine-tune an AI-driven recommendation system for more accurate roommate matches.
Verified Profiles: Introduce a profile verification process to ensure authenticity and build trust.
In-App Communication Tools: Add features for direct communication, such as calls and texts, within the app.
Compatibility Quiz: Create a detailed quiz to assess living habits and preferences, improving match accuracy.
